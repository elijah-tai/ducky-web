# What is Ducky?

Ducky is a little side project of mine that was created to help my friends ask each other for favors. It was built upon the simple premise that if Person A were closer to a certain location compared to Person B, and if the travel cost for Person A to bring an item to Person B was not greater than the benefit, then Person A could make a small amount of money from Person B by delivering the item to Person B.

### Usage
1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone git@github.com:wonjunetai/ducky.git
```

2. ``` bundle install ``` to install all required gems.
3. ```rails s``` to launch the server.
